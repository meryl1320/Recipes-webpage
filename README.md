### Project Description
[Our project is just a simple webpage for heartwarming food recipes. We're aiming to bring the warmth and care of our nature and the rich flavours it gives us to our table as a dish we'll always crave for.]

### The Problem statement
[Well We're not aiming to solve a problem, we're just trying to make a webpage that satisfies us when we're searching for hours and hours to decide on somethimg new to make. This project is simply self-satisfaction from our part and a pure bliss.]

### The Solution
[We created a page, that is not how we wanted it to be, but still close to what we were expecting. And as of the whole part of the project, it's still not developed. I want to complete this project. But my knwoledge in coding and these computer languages is limited.  Still i worked hard on this. I learned a lot. And our solution is that we're creating our own webpage to satisfy ourselves]
